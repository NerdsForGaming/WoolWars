## NOTE: This is an unofficial compilation of the plugin WoolWars by CubeCrafter
## Buy the plugin on Polymart to support him: [Link](https://polymart.org/resource/wool-wars.2551)

I would recomend you use Multiverse Core and PlaceholderAPI alongside with this plugin, It will still run without them though.
